Hey there! after pulling the project you should do the following items to see the results correctly in the browser:
1. Enter `npm install` in terminal to download all the packages from `package.json` file.
2. Change your directory to /server then run `nodemon server` in terminal.
3. Open another terminal tab and in the root and run `gulp watch`.
