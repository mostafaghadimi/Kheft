# KheftKetab.ir developer manual :))
Hey there! after pulling the project you should do the following items to see the results correctly in the browser:
1. Enter `npm install` in terminal to download all the packages from `package.json` file.
2. Change your directory to /server then run `nodemon server` in terminal.
3. Open another terminal tab and in the root and run `gulp watch`.
4. Go to the directory that you installed `MongoDB` and in the bin folder run `mongod`.
5. By entering `npm-gui localhost:9000` or arbitrary port you can see the installed packages! and you can manage it. :)
